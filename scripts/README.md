# Scripts

Scripts are sequences of commands stored in a file, intended to be executed by a specific program or scripting engine to automate processes or perform tasks on a computer system. In the context of testing, we're specifically talking about bash or powershell commands, either entered directly onto the console or written and injected by any means. Occasionally, Perl and Python codes are also treated like scripts.
