# Protocols

Protocols are sets of rules or standards that define how data is transmitted and received over a network. They ensure that devices on a network can communicate effectively, regardless of their underlying hardware or software differences. Protocols specify the formats for data packets, the procedures for sending and receiving them, and the actions taken upon transmission errors or other network events.
