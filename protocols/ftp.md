# FTP Protocol: Overview and Security Considerations

## Overview
The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used for the transfer of computer files between a client and server on a computer network. FTP is built on a client-server model architecture using separate control and data connections between the client and the server. It dates back to 1971, with the current specification, RFC 959, published in 1985.

## How It Works
FTP works by opening two connections between the client and the server: a control connection for commands and responses, and a data connection for transferring files. Users authenticate to the FTP server using a username and password, although anonymous access may be permitted. Once connected, users can upload, download, rename, move, and delete files on the server.
```bash
Kaushik Dey@htb[/htb]$ ftp -p 10.129.42.253

Connected to 10.129.42.253.
220 (vsFTPd 3.0.3)
Name (10.129.42.253:user): anonymous
230 Login successful.
Remote system type is UNIX.
Using binary mode to transfer files.

ftp> ls
227 Entering Passive Mode (10,129,42,253,158,60).
150 Here comes the directory listing.
drwxr-xr-x    2 ftp      ftp          4096 Feb 25 19:25 pub
226 Directory send OK.

ftp> cd pub
250 Directory successfully changed.

ftp> ls
227 Entering Passive Mode (10,129,42,253,182,129).
150 Here comes the directory listing.
-rw-r--r--    1 ftp      ftp            18 Feb 25 19:25 login.txt
226 Directory send OK.

ftp> get login.txt
local: login.txt remote: login.txt
227 Entering Passive Mode (10,129,42,253,181,53).
150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for login.txt (18 bytes).
226 Transfer complete.
18 bytes received in 0.00 secs (165.8314 kB/s)

ftp> exit
221 Goodbye.
```

## Affected Systems
- Servers running FTP services are potentially exposed to unauthorized access, data breaches, and data loss.
- Clients using FTP to connect to these servers, particularly if sensitive or confidential information is being transferred.

## Exploitation
Risks associated with using FTP include:
1. Lack of encryption: FTP does not inherently encrypt data, leaving transferred data, including credentials, susceptible to interception by attackers.
2. Brute force attacks: Attackers can attempt to gain unauthorized access by guessing usernames and passwords.
3. Anonymous access: Misconfigured FTP servers may allow anonymous access, potentially exposing sensitive data.

## Mitigation
- Use secure alternatives like FTPS (FTP Secure) or SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) that provide encryption for data transfers.
- Implement strong password policies and two-factor authentication to protect against brute force attacks.
- Disable anonymous access and ensure proper configuration and access controls are in place to limit exposure of sensitive data.
- Regularly update and patch FTP server software to protect against known vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion
While FTP is a widely used and historically significant protocol for file transfers, its lack of secure data transmission capabilities presents significant security risks. Organizations and individuals are encouraged to use more secure protocols like FTPS or SFTP for transferring files, especially over untrusted networks, to protect against data interception and unauthorized access.
