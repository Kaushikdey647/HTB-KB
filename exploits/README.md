# Exploits

Exploits are pieces of software, data, or commands that take advantage of a bug, glitch, or vulnerability in order to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur on computer software, hardware, or something electronic (usually computerized). This behavior often includes gaining control over a system's resources, escalating privileges, or denying services to legitimate users. Exploits are a key component in the execution of cyber attacks and are utilized within the context of penetration testing to demonstrate how an attacker could gain unauthorized access or cause harm.

Exploits are categorized based on the type of vulnerability they target, such as:

1. **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Allows the attacker to run arbitrary code on the victim machine.
2. **SQL Injection:** Exploits vulnerabilities in SQL databases to execute unauthorized SQL commands.
3. **Buffer Overflow:** Overwrites memory segments of a program
