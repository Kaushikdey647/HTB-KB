# Kaushik's Pentesting Knowledge Base

This page is a compilation of all I've learned in Hack The Box Academy throughout my last few months at college. I have been attempting pentesting since a while, but couldn't due to a lot of factors. Finally I believe I have some time to focus on something I always wanted to learn, enough of rant, anyways, lets get to the stuff, check on the menu beside you, and pop up any article you want to read. Adios.
